## Analysis Goals

In this project, my goal is to analyse the uploaded dataset to understand key patterns and insights. Specifically, I aim to identify trends, make comparisons, generate visualisations, and answer the main research questions related to the data.

## Description of the Data

## The data I have uploaded contains information about \[brief description\]. It includes variables such as \[list important variables\]. The dataset will be used for cleaning, exploration, visualisation, and statistical analysis throughout this report.

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)

# Load data
raw_data <- read_csv(here::here("data/raw/unhcrwash.csv"))
`


```
